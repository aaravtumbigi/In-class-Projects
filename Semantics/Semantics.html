    <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
    <p>Dogs are known for their loyalty and companionship. They have been bred for various tasks,
         including hunting, herding, and guarding.
                Dogs communicate through a combination of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions.
                They require regular exercise, a balanced diet, and social interaction to thrive.
                Dogs have an exceptional sense of smell, which is why they are often used in search and rescue operations, 
        as well as in detecting substances like drugs and explosives.
                The average lifespan of a dog varies by breed, but many dogs live between 10 to 15 years.
                Dogs are highly trainable and can learn a variety of commands and tricks, 
        making them popular pets for families and individuals alike.
